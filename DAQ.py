    :rtype: tuple
    :param E_DC: Constant potential to hold during perturbation in V
    :param E_AC: Magnitude of the perturbation potential in V
    :param freq: Array of perturbation potential frequencies in Hz
    :param Rm: Resistance of the measurement resistor in Î©
    :param samp_rate: Sampling rate in Hz
    :param extra_samps: Samples to acquire before and after data used to determine Y and Z
    :param ai1_delay: Empirical delay between ai0 and ai1 acquisitions in s
    :return: DataFrame holding values of Ecell, iw, time, Y, Z for each frequency

    This function creates and writes the program potential array into the ao0 output of the DAQ
    and then initiates its output to Ein of the pstat.

    At the same time, potential acquisitions are made at the ai0 and ai1
    inputs of the DAQ: ai0 measures Ecell while ai1 measures iwRm.

    Complex Y and Z are determined from the middle num_samps
    data values, accounting for the delay of ai1 relative to ai0.
