# CHEM274

## Analysis-todos
1. EIS circuit modeling with Circuit from paper, Randles, FLW. Compare!
	- Check validity of data with Kramers-Kronig
	- EIS from pure electrolyte or far below redox potential to determine $C_{dl}$ 
	- Extract $R_u$ for CV $iR_u$ correction
2. $iR_u$ corrected CV fitting to extract diffusion constants. Compare with lit!
	- Determine $\psi$ parameters
	- $k^\circ$ from CVs via Nicholson, EIS. Compare!
	- Compute $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ from $k^\circ$ just for shits
3. Look at trends in $k^\circ$ and $E_{1/2}$
	- Correlate to trends in $\varepsilon_r$ and/or $\mu$.

**Open Questions**

Are the Red and Ox diffusion constants equal?
How does $\psi$ depend on $R_u$?
How does one do Nicholson analysis anyway?

What code needs modified for better data management?
